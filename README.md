Create Flappy Bird Game

# NOTE TO DEVELOPERS
- **ONLY LET NAV MERGE OR PUSH TO MAIN!!!!!!!**
- **DO NOT PUSH TO THE MAIN ORIGIN BRANCH!!!!!!!**
- Create features in branches (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV0kVNvkMxc)
- - if u need features from other developer's files either:
  - 1. ask them to implement + merge to main
    2. *(recommended)* create "fake method" to simulate results until they finish
    3. i.e. if u need the last score, just create a last score method in ur file and return rng numbers until the person responsible for method finishes
